                  the Catan board game detailing which hexagon will have Wood,
                  Ore, Hay, Sheep, Brick and a desert. It will also assign a
                  number (between 1-12 excluding 7 which is reserved for robber)
                  to each of the hexagons excluding desert which will have a
                  robber on it at the beginning of the game. Programming
                  Languages: HTML and JS. Justification: Project involves GUI
                  and implementing it in HTML/JS is simpler in our opinion, and
                  also, all of our team members are comfortable to work in

                Project Description: This Python program that reads an input
                JSON file, parse survey questions, and ask the user (who is
                taking a survey) a list of those questions and save user's
                responses in an output JSON file located in the users home
                directory (irrespective of the OS platform). Assumption: the ID
                names are unique, but there can be multiple ID names and some
                surveys do not have ID information. When asking the questions,
                program should display the organization name along with the
                survey description before asking the questions. Questions can
                have predefined answers (multiple choices) or if none are given
                then any arbitrary input from the user is acceptable. There
                should be a blank line between the each question and the first
                question and the header. Save the results for each question in a
                dictionary using the question ID as the key. Also save the first
                and last name in the dictionary using “first_name” and
                “last_name” as the key. If an ID has been requested in the
                survey, then also include that using the appropriate ID key with
                their actual ID. The survey questions are in an input JSON file,
                the python program needs to read that input survey JSON file,
                parse the information from it. Save the result in another output
                JSON file that is named as follows:
                "survey_name"_"last_name"_"first_name"(_"id_if_needed").json If
                the user runs the survey program again and they have already
                answered the survey (then appropriate information is already in
                the configuration file), then display their results to the
                questions and ask the user to confirm thee information from the
                file is still correct every time the program runs or if they
                would like to correct any information and re-submit it. Outline
                the main reasons for building this project: It was a programming
                assignment for a course I took recently. It was fun learning how
                to read/write JSON files in Python. <br />

                Built wireless audio solutions in various infotainment systems
                to Nissan, General Motors, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover,
                Mercedes-Benz, Suzuki. Those infotainment systems were deployed
                in millions of vehicles/year for almost 6 years. Wrote code to
                implement audio architecture, features, validate the
                functionality of the audio solution, fixing bugs, managing team
                and budget for audio solutions component etc. Helping write test
                automation frameworks, using robotics for test automation was a
                fun part of this project. Audio design was done using Bluetooh
                subsystems. <br />

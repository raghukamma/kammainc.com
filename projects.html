            <p class="project-description">
              Catan Randomizer application generates a random game board for the
              Catan board game detailing which hexagon will have Wood, Ore, Hay,
              Sheep, Brick and a desert. It will also assign a number (between
              1-12 excluding 7 which is reserved for robber) to each of the
              hexagons excluding desert which will have a robber on it at the
              beginning of the game. Programming Languages: HTML and JS.
              Justification: Project involves GUI and implementing it in HTML/JS
              is simpler in our opinion, and also, all of our team members are
              comfortable to work in HTML/JS

            <p class="project-title">Survey Application in Python</p>
            <p class="project-description">
              Project Description: This Python program that reads an input JSON
              file, parse survey questions, and ask the user (who is taking a
              survey) a list of those questions and save user's responses in an
              output JSON file located in the users home directory (irrespective
              of the OS platform). Assumption: the ID names are unique, but
              there can be multiple ID names and some surveys do not have ID
              information. When asking the questions, program should display the
              organization name along with the survey description before asking
              the questions. Questions can have predefined answers (multiple
              choices) or if none are given then any arbitrary input from the
              user is acceptable. There should be a blank line between the each
              question and the first question and the header. Save the results
              for each question in a dictionary using the question ID as the
              key. Also save the first and last name in the dictionary using
              “first_name” and “last_name” as the key. If an ID has been
              requested in the survey, then also include that using the
              appropriate ID key with their actual ID. The survey questions are
              in an input JSON file, the python program needs to read that input
              survey JSON file, parse the information from it. Save the result
              in another output JSON file that is named as follows:
              "survey_name"_"last_name"_"first_name"(_"id_if_needed").json If
              the user runs the survey program again and they have already
              answered the survey (then appropriate information is already in
              the configuration file), then display their results to the
              questions and ask the user to confirm thee information from the
              file is still correct every time the program runs or if they would
              like to correct any information and re-submit it. Outline the main
              reasons for building this project: It was a programming assignment
              for a course I took recently. It was fun learning how to
              read/write JSON files in Python. <br />

              Wireless Audio Solutions - Infotainment Systems
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
              Built wireless audio solutions in various infotainment systems to
              Nissan, General Motors, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz,
              Suzuki. Those infotainment systems were deployed in millions of
              vehicles/year for almost 6 years. Wrote code to implement audio
              architecture, features, validate the functionality of the audio
              solution, fixing bugs, managing team and budget for audio
              solutions component etc. Helping write test automation frameworks,
              using robotics for test automation was a fun part of this project.
              Audio design was done using Bluetooh subsystems. <br />
              Programming Languages: C, C++, Python.

            <p class="project-description">
              Helping build a True Wireless Stereo (TWS) audio solution that
              goes into earpods, headsets, gaming consoles etc. maufactured by
              many OEMs. This solution creates two seperate audio links between
              the smartphones and headsets (unlike many in the market today that
              are not true TWS solutions). I am solving challenging engineering
              problems everyday and are delivering low latency in these audio
              products.

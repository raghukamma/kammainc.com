            I help build state of the art audio solutions at Skyworks Solutions.
            Most of these audio solutions end up in the hands of consumers to experience the lowest latency in the industry, noise cancellation/suppression is done using ML algorithms. Developing these world class audio solutions has been an interesting part of my career for the past couple of years.
            I'm a hardware and firmware engineer. Being familiar with both the hardware and software allows me to design both to work together seamlessly. I also lead compliance efforts for various products - host software stacks, applications, RF, Integrated Circuits designed for mixed signal solutions.
            
            I've worked as a project manager as well - responsible for managing the cost, schedule, scope, risk, integration, quality, and resources. Successfully delivered ~20 embedded products as a project manager within the planned cost and schedule over the last 9 years of my professional career. 
            Results oriented engineer with broad engineering experience and a proven record of business achievements. Accomplished business objectives by leading technical/business personnel and development/coaching of collaborative teams. 
            
            Interested in new product line development, product strategy, organizational development, AI, and ML technologies.
            I am currently up-skilling my AI & ML skills in the CS department at the Portland State.
